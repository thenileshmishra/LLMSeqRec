# LLMSeqRec: An LLM-Enhanced Contextual Sequential Recommender

LLMSeqRec is an innovative framework that integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-generated semantic embeddings with traditional sequential recommendation architectures. By leveraging deep semantic representations extracted from rich textual item metadata, LLMSeqRec improves recommendation accuracy, especially in cold-start and sparse data scenarios. This project implements both the proposed LLMSeqRec and a baseline SASRec model, using the MovieLens dataset to evaluate performance.

## Overview
LLMSeqRec enhances sequential recommendation by fusing two embedding modalities:
- **LLM-based Embeddings:** Pretrained semantic embeddings generated from item descriptions.
- **ID-based Embeddings:** Learnable collaborative embeddings.
  
The model employs a Transformer-based architecture (inspired by SASRec) with causal masking and multiple self-attention layers. This project includes training and evaluation scripts for both LLMSeqRec and a baseline SASRec model, alongside modules for logging and result visualization.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib (for plotting)
- Additional packages as required (see `requirements.txt` if available)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LLMSeqRec.git
   cd LLMSeqRec
   ```
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data Preparation
1. Download the MovieLens dataset from [GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
2. Place raw files in the `data/raw/` folder.
3. Run the data preprocessing scripts to generate processed CSV files and compute LLM embeddings (stored in `data/processed/`).

## Usage

### Training
- To train the LLMSeqRec model:
  ```bash
  python -m LLMSeqRec.train.train_llmseqrec
  ```
- To train the SASRec baseline:
  ```bash
  python -m LLMSeqRec.train.train_sasrec
  ```

Training logs and metrics are saved in the `logs/` folder.

### Evaluation
- To evaluate the LLMSeqRec model on the validation set:
  ```bash
  python -m LLMSeqRec.eval.evaluate --val_csv "data/processed/val_sequences.csv" --emb_path "data/processed/llm_embeddings.npy" --top_k 10
  ```
- For the baseline, modify the import in the evaluation script accordingly.

### Plotting Results
Generate visual comparisons of training loss and evaluation metrics:
```bash
python -m LLMSeqRec.eval.analysis
```
This script reads CSV logs from the `logs/` folder and creates plots in the `logs/` directory.

## Future Scope
Future work may include integrating knowledge graphs to further enhance the semantic representation of items. By incorporating structured domain knowledge, such as genre hierarchies and actor/director relationships, the model could better capture intricate item interrelations and provide more explainable recommendations. Additionally, multimodal data such as images and reviews could be integrated to create richer, multi-dimensional embeddings. Optimizing the model for real-time recommendation and scaling it to larger, more diverse datasets also represents promising avenues for further research.
